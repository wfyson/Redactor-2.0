##Redact the contents of a Word document (.docx) or PowerPoint presentation (.pptx)

This tool uses CC Search to locate free-to-use, licensed alternatives for sensitive and/or copyright-infringing images. Replacement images are automatically downloaded and inserted into the supplied Word document or PowerPoint presentation (with a caption to provide an attribution.)

This tool also embeds licence metadata in existing images, and obscures sensitive and/or copyright-infringing images for which no replacement is available.
